## Description
Repository of the project developed for the "Software Engineering 2" course, part of the Master of Science in Computer Science and Engineering at Politecnico di Milano.

This course aims at providing students with the knowledge and skills needed to carefully design a complex software system from the requirements down to the actual code itself.

This repository refers to the 2019 edition of the course, whose main topic is a system for collecting and sharing health data. The final delivery is an iOS application that interacts with Apple's HealthKit to collect data, forwards it to a server deployed on Amazon's EC2 for processing, and then stores it on Amazon's RDS.

The project has been developed with the following technologies:
- Backend: Node.js
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Frontend: Swift
